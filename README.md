# **Bookbot**

# Overview

Welcome to Bookbot! ðŸ“š This project marks my foray into Python development, and it has been an exhilarating journey. Witnessing the output on the console for the first time was a moment of sheer joy.

# Project Description

Bookbot is a Python project designed to analyze the text of a book. It performs tasks such as counting the words and characters in the entire book. After analysis, it generates a final report displaying the total number of words and how many times each alphabet occurred, sorted from larger to smaller frequency. The report is then displayed on the console.

By building this project, I've honed my skills in writing multiple functions in Python, utilizing lists, dictionaries, sorting functions, as well as employing control structures like if-else statements and for loops to iterate over lists and dictionaries.

## Getting Started

To explore Bookbot, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
```
  git clone https://github.com/komalgill0310/bookbot
```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Move into the project directory using the following command:
```
  cd bookbot
```

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script to perform analysis and generate the report.
```
  python bookbot.py
```

Now, you're all set! Witness the magic of Bookbot as it analyzes the text of your favorite books.

## What I've Learned

Building Bookbot has been an enriching experience, teaching me:

- **Function Modularity**: Breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable functions for better code organization and readability.

- **Data Structures**: Understanding the use of lists and dictionaries for storing and manipulating data efficiently.

- **Control Structures**: Utilizing if-else statements and loops effectively to control program flow and iterate over data structures.
